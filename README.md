# Vote on SIP-015!

This SIP proposes a set of updates to three major areas of the Stacks blockchain:

1. Stacking, the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus algorithm as implemented in the Stacks chain and originally proposed in [SIP-007](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/feat/sip-015/sips/sip-015/sip-015-network-upgrade.md).
2. Clarity, the smart contract language supported on the Stacks blockchain.
3. Block Validation, the procedure by which blocks are determined to be acceptable to the Stacks blockchain.
